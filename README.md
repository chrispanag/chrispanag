### Hi there 👋

My name is Christos, and I'm a Mid-Level Backend Engineer, working mainly with **Node.js** and **Typescript**. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [custom chatbot framework, Ebony](https://github.com/chrispanag/ebony).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir and I'm generally trying to start working more with functional languages.
- 📫 You can reach by sending a message to **chrispanag@gmail.com** or you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispanag/)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play the guitar and I love greek rembetiko music so much that I administer a greek rembetiko music community on the web, [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr)!
